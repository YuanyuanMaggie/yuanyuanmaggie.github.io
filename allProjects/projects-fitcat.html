				<h4>Requirements</h4>
				<p>The Cornell Feline Health Center is dedicated to improving the health and well-being of cats everywhere by: (1) educating veterinary professionals, cat owners, breeders, and conservationists about feline health by providing timely medical information and by promoting public understanding and awareness of feline issues; (2) finding ways of preventing and curing diseases of cats by conducting and sponsoring breakthrough feline health studies; and (3) aiding veterinarians when new or unknown feline diseases occur.</p>
				<p class="textleft">FitCat Weight Loss is a four-step app with following steps: (1) plan the weight loss program, (2) help the owner shop for food to meet the plan, (3) record what the cat eats, and (4) track actual vs. planned weight loss. The goal of this project was to implement the planning step only. The planning step involves: (1) teaching the owner how to judge their cat’s body condition (a visual/tactile measure of the cat’s degree of obesity), (2) getting the actual body condition from the owner, (3) using the the cat’s actual weight and the recommended safe weight loss rate to project the goal weight, the time to reach the goal, and the maximum calories and grams of fat per day for the cat to achieve the goal in the given time.</p>
