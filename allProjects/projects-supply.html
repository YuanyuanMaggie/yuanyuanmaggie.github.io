			<p class="project-description">Developed fully functional responsive new websites for e-commerce, using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, Java, AJAX and FreeMarker as well as tools like Sublime Text, Eclipse, SVN and Adobe Photoshop. <br/>
			In addition to the development, I also designed prototypes based on business requirements and then translated prototypes and designs into clean, valid, and launch-ready pages. So I can bridge the gap between uiDesignal design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defined how the application looks as well as how it work.</p>
