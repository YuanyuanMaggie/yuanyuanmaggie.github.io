				<h4>Problems</h4>
				<p>
					When arriving on a college campus for the first time, new students are forced to rapidly adapt to their new social and work environment over the course of their study. This task is daunting in its own right, but is made so much more difficult when the student’s diet is limited by a GI disease, severe allergy, or other dietary restriction. Students with these conditions may often put their health at risk when they don’t have the time or energy to ensure they are maintaining their diet, and may also feel socially limited when they are unable to eat at the same places as their friends.

				<h4> Our solutions</h4>
				<p>
					To help Cornell students with diet restrictions, especially new students, we developed Cornell MenU: a mobile application designed to provide streamlined and filtered menu information about on-campus meal halls based on the user’s dietary restriction that will also serve to connect newer students with older students with similar conditions to create an information sharing network.
				</p>
				<h4>Paper prototypes</h4>
				<p>Our product is a mobile application which obviously meets the first goal that users need; an App format which is user friendly and convenient. We first used paper prototypes to test concepts and got quick feedback from target students. </p>

                <h4>Hign Quality Prototypes</h4>  
				<p>After individual and group heuristic evaluations on the paper prototypes, we built our high quality prototype by Photoshop and Axure RP. </p>
