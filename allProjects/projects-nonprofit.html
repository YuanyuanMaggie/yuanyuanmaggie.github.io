				<h4>Target problems</h4>
				<p>Family and Children Services of Ithaca has witnessed there is a lack of basic resources for low income individuals and families and people in poverty to feed themselves or their families on a daily basis. Many individuals sit or stand with a sign requesting money for food, for housing, or basic survival. Community members sometimes respond with money and / or food. The act of holding a sign can degrade the self- esteem of individuals as well as it is not welcome site to members of the community. The organization would like to see an alternative way for individuals to donate and receive the funds they need to eat.</p>
